# Project 0 - Submitting Projects

## Introduction

The projects for this class assume you can do the following:
- Use a *CLI* (command line interface) to perform system level functions
- Use a *CLI* or *IDE* to manage and update files
- Use fundamental programming knowledge from prior courses to pickup languages used in this course

Project 0 will require you to:

- Download template files
- Make a simple text file update
- Zip files and submit to an LMS
- Provide links to resources used throughout this class

### Files to Edit and Submit

You will fill in portions of ```p0.html```. Please do not change the other files in this repository or add new files to your repository. Submit project as a zip of the file(s) via Moodle. The due dates for projects are listed on the syllabus. No late project will be accepted without a starfish notice.

### Evaluation

Most of the grade for each project is based on the functionality of your project. There are also style points which are awarded based on how you solve the problem. These reflect the importance of things such as proper HTML validation, clean code structure, and nice-looking interfaces. The style points are described in each project.

## Browsers

Web browsers are still not 100% identical in their behavior, and it is possible for web pages to behave differently on different browsers. For this course, the reference browser is Chrome.  Your project solutions must work on Chrome.  You may use a different browser to develop your solutions if you wish.  Chrome, Firefox, and Safari all have very similar behavior. Please test on Chrome before submitting. We do not recommend that you use Internet Explorer for development. Historically, its behavior has been quite different from the other browsers.

### Academic Dishonesty and Getting Help

Please follow the [50 foot Policy](https://www.dna.caltech.edu/courses/cs191/50ft_policy.pdf) when collaborating on projects.

## References

There are no required textbooks for this class. To complete programming projects, you will need additional reference material that is available on the Web.

### MERN Stack

The web applications built in the course's projects will use what is known as the MERN stack. The MERN stack uses the JavaScript language in both the browser and the server-side.

## Q1: Your Name

- Download the files for [p0](https://github.com/btdobbs/WA/tree/main/Project/00/p0)
- Update the word *My* in p0.html to the possessive form of your name.  There are two changes to make.
  - **Example:** If my name is Bob, I would change *My test page* to *Bob's test page* 

## Submission

- Zip the following files and submit
  - p0.html
